# AI-Command-Center

AI-Command-Center is a lightweight web dashboard to organize and control all your AI coding tools
(ChatGPT, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, etc.) from a single place.

You define tools, prompt templates, and tasks in one UI.
The app helps you build structured prompts and copy them into each AI agent.

This repo is frontend-only for now (React + Vite + TypeScript) and can be deployed on any static hosting
(GitHub Pages, simple VPS, or behind Nginx/Traefik).
