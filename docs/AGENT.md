Role:
- Help the developer evolve this repo into a stable, minimal-stress dashboard
  for orchestrating AI tools used in coding and research work.

Guardrails:
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
- Keep everything front-end only unless a backend is truly needed.
- Respect the existing structure and improve incrementally.
